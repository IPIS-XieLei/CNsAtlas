# Automated Mapping the Pathways of Cranial Nerve II, III, V, and VII/VIII: A Multi-Parametric Multi-Stage Diffusion Tractography Atlas

---

Automated Mapping the Pathways of Cranial Nerve II, III, V, and VII/VIII: A Multi-Parametric Multi-Stage Diffusion Tractography Atlas. Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering.

In this work, we present what we believe to be the first
study to develop a comprehensive diffusion tractography
atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human
brain. The CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by
using the streamlines generated by multi-parametric fiber
tractography for each pair of CNs, which can identify 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic
nerve CN II, oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN
V and facial-vestibulocochlear nerve CN VII/VIII.

---
1.Install FSL, installation documentation is in: https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl

2.Install Mrtrix3 with conda:
```
$ conda install -c mrtrix3 mrtrix3
```
3.Install 3D Slicer, installation documentation is in: https://download.slicer.org/

4.Install whitematteranalysis with pip:
```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/SlicerDMRI/whitematteranalysis.git
```
Run```wm_quality_control_tractography.py```--help to test if the installation is successful.
# **How to use**
---
The input files of the following shells need to be modified accordingly.

---
1. Register the seeding and mask in the MNI space to the individual subject
```
bash 1_MaskGatedFronMNI.sh
```
---
2. Fiber tractography for each pair of CNs in seeding and mask
```
bash 2_TrackUsingUKF.sh
```
Of course, alternative tractography techniques (deterministic, probabilistic and PTT) could be implemented , provided they yield anatomically plausible streamlines.
```
bash 2.1_Track_CSD.sh
```
---
3. The obtained fiber streamline is registered into the CN atlas space and multi-stage fiber clustering
```
bash 3_MapCNsFromAtlas.sh
```
---
4. The results of fiber clustering are registered into the individual subject space.```CNs_all_VTK.vtk```is the final result is output.
```
bash 4_AtlastoSubjectRegi.sh
```
---
We hope this resource will enhance standardization in diffusion MRI analysis and welcome collaborations to continue the precision of this atlas and extend the atlas to other CNs. Feel free to ask questions at any time.
